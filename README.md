# Noise-vs-Resolution
Programming code for the estimation of measurement uncertainty (and it's propagation) of optical chemical sensors using the ratiometric imaging approach.
The programming code is associated to the corresponding publication in Sensors and Actuators B: 
Noise vs. resolution in optical chemical imaging â€“ How reliable are our measurements?!

The following notebooks are provided: 
- UncertaintyProp-O2calibration: interactive step-by-step calibration of the optical chemical sensors (optodes) for oxygen imaging and the estimation of uncertainty propagation across a (non-linear) Stern-Volmer fit model
- O2conc_imageEvaluation: step-by-step explanation of uncertainty propagtion along the evaluation process
- DepthProfile: impact of denoising filters on the image resolution and the penetration depth at an anoxic-oxic transition

All crucial information to understand the code are provided within the script. Associated data can be downloaded from Mendeley data (doi: 10.17632/sp5rgjt6v4.1)
